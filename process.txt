Step 1: Preprocessing

Import Libraries:

json for parsing JSON files
nltk for natural language processing and text preprocessing
datetime for date manipulation
pandas for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib for plotting the timeline

Load the JSON File:

Load the JSON file containing the news articles into a Python dictionary.

Text Preprocessing:

Use nltk to tokenize the text and remove punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant symbols.
Convert all text to lowercase.

Step 2: Event Extraction

Identify Relevant Articles:

Filter the articles to only include those related to the Israel-Hamas war.

Extract Dates and Events:

Use nltk to identify dates and events in the relevant articles.
Extract the dates and events from the text.

Step 3: Timeline Creation

Create a Dictionary for Timeline:

Create a dictionary to store the extracted dates and events.

Populate the Timeline Dictionary:

Iterate over the extracted dates and events and populate the timeline dictionary.

Plot the Timeline:

Use matplotlib to create a plot of the timeline.

Step 4: Output

Print the Timeline:
Print the timeline dictionary to a file or display it in a user-friendly format.
